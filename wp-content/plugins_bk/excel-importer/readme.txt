Import posts from CSV files into WordPress.


== Description ==

This plugin imports posts from xls (xlsx) files into your
WordPress blog. It can prove extremely useful when you want to import a bunch
of posts from an Excel document or the like - simply export your document into
a xls (xlsx) file and the plugin will take care of the rest.

= Features =

*   Imports post title, body, excerpt, tags, date, categories etc.
*   Supports custom fields, custom taxonomies and comments
*   Deals with Word-style quotes and other non-standard characters using
    WordPress' built-in mechanism (same one that normalizes your input when you
    write your posts)
*   Columns in the CSV file can be in any order, provided that they have correct
    headings
*   Multi-language support
